Development notes:

Jenkisn monitoring - sound only
As SM I want to 

Open:
? Have my login data encrypted so that nobody can see them
? Be able to configure different sound sets for different builds 

Done:
8 Hear if a build has failed so that I can react immediately
3 Only hear if it failed first time so that i am not disturbed
1 Hear if a failed build succeeded so that I know its fine
1 Hear if the last failed build succeded so that I know everything is fine
1 Hear if the first build faild so that I know it was green before


Architecture :)
- bash get file + mv oldfile to newfile
------ ruby -----
- call script file1 file2
- Load files in string
- Parse oldfile, newfile
- merge projects by name, oldstatus, newstatus -> hashmap
- calculate status list
- output result to bash
----------
- bash case play
- cronjob to call periodically

Possible States:
AllOk (includes no change)
LastFixed
FirstFailure
NewFailure
StillFailing
OneFixed
